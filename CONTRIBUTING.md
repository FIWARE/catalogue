# Contributing to the FIWARE Catalogue

The FIWARE Catalogue is an umbrella repository covering the individual components of FIWARE, it does not
usually accept PRs directly. Contributors should raise ideas and issues within the individual FIWARE Generic Enabler 
repositories which can be navigated to from this repository. 

You can contribute to FIWARE technically by different means: contributing code for a given FIWARE component, helping to develop tutorials/training
material which are made freely available to developers, supporting QA activities or supporting the operations of the FIWARE Lab.

## Ground rules & expectations

Before we get started, here are a few things we expect from you (and that you should expect from others):

-   Be kind and thoughtful in your conversations around this project. We all come from different backgrounds and
    projects, which means we likely have different perspectives on "how open source is done." Try to listen to others
    rather than convince them that your way is correct.
-   Each project is released with a Contributor Code of Conduct. By participating in this project, you agree to abide by its terms.
-   If you open a pull request, you must sign the Individual Contributor License Agreement stating in a comment
    _"I have read the CLA Document and I hereby sign the CLA"_
-   Please ensure that your contribution passes all tests. If there are test failures, you will need to address them
    before we can merge your contribution.
-   When adding content, please consider if it is widely valuable. Please don't add references or links to things you or
    your employer have created as others will do so if they appreciate it.

## How to contribute

The application process for joining the FIWARE Initiative is described in the links below. To be adopted as a Generic Enabler within FIWARE,
each open source component must fulfill a number of [contribution requirements](https://fiware-requirements.readthedocs.io), follow common

direction of FIWARE is governed by the FIWARE Technical Steering Committee (TSC).
