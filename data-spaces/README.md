# FIWARE for Data Spaces

This section describes how smart applications from multiple domains can participate in the 
creation of data spaces based on FIWARE generic enablers. Smart applications participating 
in such data spaces share digital twin data in real-time using a common standard API like 
NGSI-LD and rely on standard data models. Each smart solution contributes to build a 
complete digital twin data representation of the real world sharing their data. At the same 
time, they can exploit data shared by other applications. Relying on FIWARE Data Marketplace 
components, smart applications can publish data under concrete terms and conditions which 
include pricing or data usage/access policies.
