### What is Cosmos?

The Cosmos BigData Analysis GE is a set of tools helping in the task of enabling a [Hadoop](https://hadoop.apache.org/) as a Service (HasS) deployment:

* A set of administration tools such as [HDFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Hadoop#HDFS) data copiers etc.
* An OAuth2 token generator
* A web portal for users and accounts management, running MapReduce jobs and doing I/O of big data
* A custom authentication provider for Hive
* A REST API for running MapReduce jobs in a shared Hadoop cluster
* A specific OAuth2-base proxy for Http/REST operations

### Why use Cosmos?

As the state of the real world changes, the entities representing your IoT devices are constantly changing. Big data analysis allows for the study of datasets coming from your context data which are too large for traditional data-processing software. You can apply predictive analysis or user behaviour analytics to extract meaningful conclusions as to the state of your smart solution and bring value to your solution.

### What is Wirecloud

Wirecloud is a web mashup tool designed to ease the development of  operational dashboards. This allows end users to easily create web applications and dashboards without programming skills and to visualize
data of interest and control their environment.

Web application mashups integrate heterogeneous data, application logic, and 
UI components (widgets) sourced from the Web to create new coherent and value-adding composite applications. They are targeted at leveraging the "long tail" of the Web of Services (a.k.a. the Programmable Web) by exploiting rapid development, DIY, and shareability.

Mashups typically serve a specific situational (i.e. immediate, bespoke, short-term) need, frequently with limited potential for reuse. Is this "situational" character which precludes them to be offered as 'off-the-shelf' functionality by solution providers, and therefore creates the need for a tool like Wirecloud.


### Why use Wirecloud

Web application mashups can be manually developed using conventional web programming technologies but this fails to take full advantage of the approach. Mashup tools and platforms like Wirecloud aim at development paradigms that do not require programming skills and, hence, target end users, being them citizens, knowledge workers, portal designers, etc.

By using Wirecloud you have access to the following key features:

* Innovate through experimentation by choosing the best suited widgets, operators and prefab mashup-lets for your devised mashup from a vast, ever-growing distributed catalogue
* The wiring editor allows you to easily connect widgets in a mashup to create a full-fledged dashboard with RIA functionality
* The piping editor allows you to easily connect widgets to back-end services or data sources through an extendable set of operators, including filters, aggregators, adapters, etc.
* Share your newly created mashup with other colleagues and users. Comment it, tag it and rate it to foster discoverability and shareability
* Help to build a strong community by commenting, tagging and rating others' widgets, operators and mashups. The platform will also do its best to complement your contribution

* [Website](https://www.kurento.org/)

### What is Kurento?
The Stream Oriented GE is a development framework that provides an abstraction layer for multimedia capabilities, allowing non-expert developers to include interactive media components to their applications. At the heart of this enabler there is the Open API. A REST-like API, based on JSON RPC 2.0, exposing a toolbox of Media Elements that can be chained to create complex media processing pipelines. The Stream Oriented GE provides several client implementations of the Open API. The Java client allows developers to include media capabilities to Java or JEE applications. There is also a Javascript client ready to be used with NodeJS or directly in browser applications. Thanks to these, the Stream Oriented GE provides developers with a set of robust end-to-end interoperable multimedia communication capabilities to deal with the complexity of transport, encoding/decoding, processing and rendering tasks in an easy and efficient way.

### Why use Kurento?

The development of interactive multimedia applications is a complex task, which usually requires specific expertise and huge investments. Stream Oriented GE brings a number of abstractions and enablers democratizing multimedia technologies and making possible to any WWW developer to create powerful applications involving advanced features such as: interoperable audiovisual communications, computer vision, augmented reality, flexible media playing, recording, etc. The Stream Oriented GE will be particularly useful and intuitive for developers familiar with Java EE and JavaScript technologies, although its capabilities are also exposed through agnostic interoperable network interfaces that can be consumed from any other language of system. In a nutshell, It makes possible the development of complex interactive multimedia communications in a fast, simple and easy way.

### What is Perseo?

The Perseo Context-aware Complex Event Processing (Context-aware CEP) GE is a module that listens to events from context data (coming from Orion Context Broker or any other NGSI-compliant system or service) in real-time, and generates immediate insight, enabling thus instant response to changing conditions

### Why use Perseo?

Event processing in a Smart Solution enables you to listen to changes in the incoming context data and identify patterns in order to react by triggering external actions (e.g sending eMails or SMS messages)

Perseo is an NSGI compliant rules-based query engine for event processing based on Esper CEP which means that rules can be defined using SQL-like queries in EPL eliminating the need to write code to hard-wire event conditions. Therefore Perseo can act as a bridge between the context data and other external systems.

The **Perseo** project is part of [FIWARE](http://fiware.org/) and will be rated as part of the next release.

* [Documentation](https://fogflow.rtfd.io/)

### What is Fog Flow?

FogFlow is an IoT edge computing framework to orchestrate dynamic processing flows over cloud and edges. It can dynamically and automatically composite multiple NGSI-based data processing tasks to form high level IoT services, and then orchestrate and optimize the deployment of those services within a shared cloud-edge environment, with regards to the availability, locality, and mobility of IoT devices.

### Why use Fog Flow?

The cost of a cloud-only solution is too high to run a large scale IoT system with >1000 geo-distributed devices
many IoT services require fast response time, such as <10ms end-to-end latency
service providers are facing huge complexity and cost to fast design and deploy their IoT services in a cloud-edge environment - business demands are changing fast over time and service providers need to try out and release any new services over their shared cloud-edge infrastructure at a fast speed
lack of programming model to fast design and deploy IoT services over geo-distributed ICT infrastructure
lack of interoperability and openness to share and reuse data and dervied results across various applications

* [Documentation](https://aeon-platform.rtfd.io/)

### What is AEON?

The Cloud Messaging GE (AEON) provides cloud services (channels) to communicate an unlimited number of entities, interchanging an unlimited amount of information. But it is not only about the communication, it also provides services for easily management of entities participating in your environments: mobile, truck, box, thermometer, even yourself...).
The Cloud Messaging GE support two main operation blocks:

Resources Management: Management of the different entities and channels.
Create, Remove, Update and Delete Entities
Create, Remove, Update and Delete Channels associated to an entity
Publish/Subscribe: Based on managing the publish and subscribe operations.
Publish information over a channel.
Subscribe to a channel. Pause, continue and stop the subscription getting a better control on your operations.
The Cloud Messaging GE offers, not only and API to mange all the resources but also it provides different SDKs to start using it by just including it in your code.

### Why use AEON?

Each time that you need to develop an application with communication needs, Cloud Messaging GE should be included. It is very difficult to set up a communication environment and it is time you loose on what really matters, develop the main functionalities of your applications. Therefore, Cloud Messaging solves this problem for you, allowing you to focus on your domain. E,g. If you want to develop an application that updates the status of a delivered package in real-time, with a few lines of code, you can update this status from the mobile terminal to the transport operator's back-office.

* [Docker](https://hub.docker.com/r/fiware/domibus-tomcat/)
* [Documentation](https://ec.europa.eu/cefdigital/wiki/display/CEFDIGITAL/Domibus)

### What is Domibus?

Domibus is a sample implementation of a [CEF eDelivery Access Point](https://ec.europa.eu/cefdigital/wiki/display/CEFDIGITAL/Access+Point+software). CEF eDelivery helps users to exchange electronic data and documents with one another in a reliable and trusted way. The CEF eDelivery solution is based on a distributed model called the “4-corner model”. In this model, the back-end systems of the users don’t exchange data directly with each other but do this through Access Points. These Access Points are conformant to the same technical specifications and therefore capable of communicating with each other. As a result of this, users adopting CEF eDelivery can easily and safely exchange data even if their IT systems were developed independently from each other.

### Why use Domibus?

eDelivery helps to achieve the following goals:
Interoperability: Implementing common technical specifications that enable diverse organisations to exchange data and documents.
Security: Promoting an atmosphere of trust among all participants in the message exchange network.
Scalability and Performance: Enabling the number of participants in the data exchange network to grow as well as the number of exchanged messages.
Legal Assurance and Accountability: Promoting a high level of transparency and confidence among all participants in the message exchange network.
Re-using CEF eDelivery will accelerate the delivery time of a working document and data exchange network and reduces the cost and risk of creating, maintaining and operating such a network. CEF eDelivery was already tried and tested in multiple domains.
