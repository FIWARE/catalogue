Security Fix(es): * Developer environment: Unicode's bidirectional (BiDi) override characters can cause trojan source attacks (CVE-2021-42574) The following changes were introduced in gcc in order to facilitate detection of BiDi Unicode characters: This update implements a new warning option -Wbidirectional to warn about possibly dangerous bidirectional characters. There are three levels of warning supported by gcc: \"-Wbidirectional=unpaired\", which warns about improperly terminated BiDi contexts. (This is the default.) \"-Wbidirectional=none\", which turns the warning off. \"-Wbidirectional=any\", which warns about any use of bidirectional characters.
