|High|lz4|0.0~r131-2|CVE-2021-3520|debian:9|There&#x27;s a flaw in lz4. An attacker who submits a crafted file to an application linked with lz4 may be able to trigger an integer overflow, leading to calling of memmove() on a negative size argument, causing an out-of-bounds write and/or a crash. The greatest impact of this flaw is to availability, with some potential impact to confidentiality and integrity as well.|https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-3520|0.0~r131-2+deb9u1|

This allows an attacker to remove themselves from a supplementary group, which may allow access to certain filesystem paths if the administrator has used &quot;group blacklisting&quot; (e.g., chmod g-rwx) to restrict access to paths.

Calling memcpy() (on ARMv7 targets that utilize the GNU glibc implementation) with a negative value for the &#x27;num&#x27; parameter results in a signed comparison vulnerability. If an attacker underflows the &#x27;num&#x27; parameter to memcpy(), this vulnerability could lead to undefined behavior such as writing to out-of-bounds memory and potentially remote code execution. Furthermore, this memcpy() implementation allows for program execution to continue in scenarios where a segmentation fault or crash should have occurred.

Specifically, this affects shadow 4.8 when compiled using --with-libpam but without explicitly passing --disable-account-tools-setuid, and without a PAM configuration suitable for use with setuid account management tools. This combination leads to account management tools (groupadd, groupdel, groupmod, useradd, userdel, usermod) that can easily be used by unprivileged local users to escalate privileges to root in multiple ways. This issue became much more relevant in approximately December 2019 when an unrelated bug was fixed (i.e., the chmod calls to suidusbins were fixed in the upstream Makefile which is now included in the release version 4.8).|https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-19882||
