|Medium|systemd|241-7~deb10u8|CVE-2019-3844|debian:10|It was discovered that a systemd service that uses DynamicUser property can get new privileges through the execution of SUID binaries, which would allow to create binaries owned by the service transient group with the setgid bit set. A local attacker may use this flaw to access resources that will be owned by a potentially different service in the future, when the GID will be recycled.|https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-3844||

|Medium|glibc|2.28-10+deb10u2|CVE-2020-1751|debian:10|An out-of-bounds write vulnerability was found in glibc before 2.31 when handling signal trampolines on PowerPC. Specifically, the backtrace function did not properly check the array bounds when storing the frame address, resulting in a denial of service or potential code execution. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.|https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-1751||

This makes it possible in some circumstances for one domain to impersonate another. By creating a malicious domain that matches a target domain except for the inclusion of certain punycoded Unicode characters (that would be discarded when converted first to a Unicode label and then back to an ASCII label), arbitrary domains can be impersonated.|https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-12290||

|Medium|systemd|241-7~deb10u8|CVE-2019-3843|debian:10|It was discovered that a systemd service that uses DynamicUser property can create a SUID/SGID binary that would be allowed to run as the transient service UID/GID even after the service is terminated. A local attacker may use this flaw to access resources that will be owned by a potentially different service in the future, when the UID/GID will be recycled.|https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-3843||
|Low|gnupg2|2.2.12-1+deb10u2|CVE-2019-14855|debian:10|A flaw was found in the way certificate signatures could be forged using collisions found in the SHA-1 algorithm.

(This issue can also lead to data corruption.) NOTE: the vendor states &quot;only a few specific / uncommon usages of the API are at risk.&quot;|https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-17543||
|Low|libgcrypt20|1.8.4-5+deb10u1|CVE-2019-13627|debian:10|It was discovered that there was a ECDSA timing attack in the libgcrypt20 cryptographic library. Version affected: 1.8.4-5, 1.7.6-2+deb9u3, and 1.6.3-2+deb8u4. Versions fixed: 1.8.5-2 and 1.6.3-2+deb8u7.|https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-13627||

This occurred because a volatile operation was not specified. For example, within a single execution of a program, the output of every __builtin_darn() call may be the same.|https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-15847||
|Low|shadow|1:4.5-1.1|CVE-2018-7169|debian:10|An issue was discovered in shadow 4.5. newgidmap (in shadow-utils) is setuid and allows an unprivileged user to be placed in a user namespace where setgroups(2) is permitted. This allows an attacker to remove themselves from a supplementary group, which may allow access to certain filesystem paths if the administrator has used &quot;group blacklisting&quot; (e.g., chmod g-rwx) to restrict access to paths. This flaw effectively reverts a security feature in the kernel (in particular, the /proc/self/setgroups knob) to prevent this sort of privilege escalation.|https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-7169||

|Negligible|systemd|241-7~deb10u8|CVE-2019-20386|debian:10|An issue was discovered in button_open in login/logind-button.c in systemd before 243. When executing the udevadm trigger command, a memory leak may occur.|https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-20386||
|Negligible|systemd|241-7~deb10u8|CVE-2020-13529|debian:10|An exploitable denial-of-service vulnerability exists in Systemd 245. A specially crafted DHCP FORCERENEW packet can cause a server running the DHCP client to be vulnerable to a DHCP ACK spoofing attack. An attacker can forge a pair of FORCERENEW and DCHP ACK packets to reconfigure the server.|https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-13529||

|Negligible|shadow|1:4.5-1.1|CVE-2019-19882|debian:10|shadow 4.8, in certain circumstances affecting at least Gentoo, Arch Linux, and Void Linux, allows local users to obtain root access because setuid programs are misconfigured. Specifically, this affects shadow 4.8 when compiled using --with-libpam but without explicitly passing --disable-account-tools-setuid, and without a PAM configuration suitable for use with setuid account management tools. This combination leads to account management tools (groupadd, groupdel, groupmod, useradd, userdel, usermod) that can easily be used by unprivileged local users to escalate privileges to root in multiple ways. This issue became much more relevant in approximately December 2019 when an unrelated bug was fixed (i.e., the chmod calls to suidusbins were fixed in the upstream Makefile which is now included in the release version 4.8).|https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-19882||

By default, if Bash is run with its effective UID not equal to its real UID, it will drop privileges by setting its effective UID to its real UID. However, it does so incorrectly. On Linux and other systems that support &quot;saved UID&quot; functionality, the saved UID is not dropped. An attacker with command execution in the shell can use &quot;enable -f&quot; for runtime loading of a new builtin, which can be a shared object that calls setuid() and therefore regains privileges.

Although it is not possible to exploit this directly (e.g., adding a new user fails because \n is in the block list), it is possible to misrepresent the /etc/passwd file when viewed. Use of \r manipulations and Unicode characters to work around blocking of the : character make it possible to give the impression that a new user has been added.
