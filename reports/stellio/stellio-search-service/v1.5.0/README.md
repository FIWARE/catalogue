Calling memcpy() (on ARMv7 targets that utilize the GNU glibc implementation) with a negative value for the &#x27;num&#x27; parameter results in a signed comparison vulnerability. If an attacker underflows the &#x27;num&#x27; parameter to memcpy(), this vulnerability could lead to undefined behavior such as writing to out-of-bounds memory and potentially remote code execution. Furthermore, this memcpy() implementation allows for program execution to continue in scenarios where a segmentation fault or crash should have occurred. The dangers occur in that subsequent execution and iterations of this code will be executed with this corrupted data.|http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2020-6096|2.31-0ubuntu9.7|

When the attacker can separate query parameters using a semicolon (;), they can cause a difference in the interpretation of the request between the proxy (running with default configuration) and the server. This can result in malicious requests being cached as completely safe ones, as the proxy would usually not see the semicolon as a separator, and therefore would not include it in a cache key of an unkeyed parameter.|http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2021-23336||

|Low|bash|5.0-6ubuntu1.1|CVE-2019-18276|ubuntu:20.04|An issue was discovered in disable_priv_mode in shell.c in GNU Bash through 5.0 patch 11. By default, if Bash is run with its effective UID not equal to its real UID, it will drop privileges by setting its effective UID to its real UID. However, it does so incorrectly. On Linux and other systems that support &quot;saved UID&quot; functionality, the saved UID is not dropped. An attacker with command execution in the shell can use &quot;enable -f&quot; for runtime loading of a new builtin, which can be a shared object that calls setuid() and therefore regains privileges.
