Calling memcpy() (on ARMv7 targets that utilize the GNU glibc implementation) with a negative value for the &#x27;num&#x27; parameter results in a signed comparison vulnerability. If an attacker underflows the &#x27;num&#x27; parameter to memcpy(), this vulnerability could lead to undefined behavior such as writing to out-of-bounds memory and potentially remote code execution. Furthermore, this memcpy() implementation allows for program execution to continue in scenarios where a segmentation fault or crash should have occurred.

On Linux and other systems that support &quot;saved UID&quot; functionality, the saved UID is not dropped. An attacker with command execution in the shell can use &quot;enable -f&quot; for runtime loading of a new builtin, which can be a shared object that calls setuid() and therefore regains privileges.
