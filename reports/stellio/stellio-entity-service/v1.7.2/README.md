|Low|bash|5.0-6ubuntu1.1|CVE-2019-18276|ubuntu:20.04|An issue was discovered in disable_priv_mode in shell.c in GNU Bash through 5.0 patch 11. By default, if Bash is run with its effective UID not equal to its real UID, it will drop privileges by setting its effective UID to its real UID. However, it does so incorrectly. On Linux and other systems that support &quot;saved UID&quot; functionality, the saved UID is not dropped. An attacker with command execution in the shell can use &quot;enable -f&quot; for runtime loading of a new builtin, which can be a shared object that calls setuid() and therefore regains privileges. However, binaries running with an effective UID of 0 are unaffected.|http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-18276|5.0-6ubuntu1.2|

|Negligible|sqlite3|3.31.1-4ubuntu0.2|CVE-2021-36690|ubuntu:20.04|** DISPUTED ** A segmentation fault can occur in the sqlite3.exe command-line component of SQLite 3.36.0 via the idxGetTableInfo function when there is a crafted SQL query. NOTE: the vendor disputes the relevance of this report because a sqlite3.exe user already has full privileges (e.g., is intentionally allowed to execute commands). This report does NOT imply any problem in the SQLite library.|http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2021-36690||

|Negligible|krb5|1.17-6ubuntu4.1|CVE-2018-5709|ubuntu:20.04|An issue was discovered in MIT Kerberos 5 (aka krb5) through 1.16. There is a variable &quot;dbentry-&gt;n_key_data&quot; in kadmin/dbutil/dump.c that can store 16-bit data but unknowingly the developer has assigned a &quot;u4&quot; variable to it, which is for 32-bit data. An attacker can use this vulnerability to affect other artifacts of the database as we know that a Kerberos database dump file contains trusted data.|http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-5709||
|Negligible|pcre3|2:8.39-12build1|CVE-2020-14155|ubuntu:20.04|libpcre in PCRE before 8.44 allows an integer overflow via a large number after a (?C substring.|http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2020-14155||
