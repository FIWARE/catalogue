# API Management, Data Publication and Monetization

Publishing and consuming open data is a cornerstone for the development of applications and the creation of an
innovation ecosystem. In this regard, this section explains how users (both end users and developers) can expose their
data publishing it in CKAN, the Open Data publication GE.

To learn more about Data Publication, check out the
[documentation](https://fiwaretourguide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/data-publication/introduction/)

### What is APInf?

The APInf API Management Framework is a Smart City orchestrator to be used together with other FIWARE enablers. APInf
integrates with FIWARE core technologies, such as [Identity Management](https://fiware-idm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/),
[NGSI v2](https://swagger.lab.fiware.org/?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Fiware/specifications/master/OpenAPI/ngsiv2/ngsiv2-openapi.json)
and [Business API Ecosystem](https://business-api-ecosystem.rtfd.io/) along with [API Umbrella](https://apiumbrella.io/)
to offer a comprehensive toolset to let various API Owners to run business with their APIs. Public market place is one
of the essential GUI tools to help API Owners to reach their customer with the showcase.

The APInf API Management Framework is a highly extendable and can bring huge benefits to managed APIs - such as NGSI
based interfaces like FIWARE Context Broker instances. This extends opportunities to setup a complete IoT cloud for
Smart Cities using FIWARE technologies alone. Both right-time data and historical data will be available for software
developers to build Smart Applications.

### Why use APInf?

The APInf API Management Framework is a central part of the FIWARE platform combining with other Generic Enablers in an
offering a dashboard for all application developers. The business tools of the framework help API Owners to run their
API business. This helps cities to distribute digital technology in small pieces in order to let local small software
companies to attend in building the services to their home city. The support is close and this approach creates jobs for
local people, which in turn generate move tax money for the city to develop better digital services to the citizens.

### What is CoatRack?

CoatRack is a framework of managed backend-to-backend communication via REST services, consisting of distributed,
lightweight API gateways and a centralized web application to generate and administer those API gateways.

CoatRack can facilitate your work if you have existing REST APIs and you want to do one (or more) of the following:

-   monitoring the access to your APIs,
-   authentication/authorization of calls to your APIs via API keys,
-   monetization of API calls, based on pay-per-call rules or flat rate monetization.

### Why use CoatRack?

If your use case includes management of backend-to-backend communication via REST APIs, for example when offering
backend services to third parties, some common boilerplate work is required in addition to developing the actual service
API.

Coatrack reduces the overhead in implementing common tasks such as:

-   mechanisms for authentication/authorisation,
-   providing access credentials to the users,
-   monitoring calls to the API,
-   generating statistics.

This allows development teams to concentrate on building and maintaining the features of their own API as a product,
without spending time on ancillary features.

The **CoatRack** project is part of [FIWARE](https://fiware.org/) and will be rated as part of the next release.
