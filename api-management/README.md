# API Management, Data Publication and Monetization

Publishing and consuming open data is a cornerstone for the development of applications and the creation of an
innovation ecosystem. In this regard, this section explains how users (both end users and developers) can expose their
data publishing it in CKAN, the Open Data publication GE.

To learn more about Data Publication, check out the
[documentation](https://fiwaretourguide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/data-publication/introduction/)

### What is CoatRack?

CoatRack is a framework of managed backend-to-backend communication via REST services, consisting of distributed,
lightweight API gateways and a centralized web application to generate and administer those API gateways.

CoatRack can facilitate your work if you have existing REST APIs and you want to do one (or more) of the following:

-   monitoring the access to your APIs,
-   authentication/authorization of calls to your APIs via API keys,
-   monetization of API calls, based on pay-per-call rules or flat rate monetization.

### Why use CoatRack?

If your use case includes management of backend-to-backend communication via REST APIs, for example when offering
backend services to third parties, some common boilerplate work is required in addition to developing the actual service
API.

Coatrack reduces the overhead in implementing common tasks such as:

-   mechanisms for authentication/authorisation,
-   providing access credentials to the users,
-   monitoring calls to the API,
-   generating statistics.

This allows development teams to concentrate on building and maintaining the features of their own API as a product,
without spending time on ancillary features.

#### What is Endpoint-Auth-Service?

In various use-cases, there is a need to apply authentication or authorization to outgoing requests for components that 
do not handle this themselves - for example notifications in NGSI-LD brokers. This service provides that by adding an 
envoy-proxy as sidecar to the component that gets forwarded all outgoing requests via ip-tables. The sidecar-proxy does
request auth-information from the auth-provider and adds it to the requests accordingly. The endpoints to be handled and 
there auth-information can be configured through endpoint-configuration-service.

#### Why use the Endpoint-Auth-Service?

Within data spaces, outgoing requests will need to be annotated as legitimate traffic coming from a specific trusted participant
from within the data space. The Endpoint-Auth-Service does this work automatically and the architecture allows separation of
the actual authentication flows from the proxy itself, thus giving more flexibility in terms of technology and reduces the complexity
of the code inside the proxy.

#### What are FIWARE Kong Plugins ?

Kong is a popular cloud-native API gateway acting as a reverse proxy ,that lets you manage, configure, and route requests to your APIs.
The functionality of Kong can be extended through the use of plugins, allowing developers to introduce new security functionality within a 
pre-existing API gateway framework

The FIWARE Kong plugins offer targeted extensions to the existing framework simplifying connections to various components which are commonly
used as part of the FIWARE Ecosystem (e.g. Keyrock, Keycloak)

#### Why use the FIWARE Kong Plugins ?

When creating a FIWARE based system, it is necessary to introduce a security system to protect your data. FIWARE is agnostic to the security
stack implemented in the system, but through using Kong it is possible to connect to the authentication and authorization mechanims of existing 
IDMs, PDPs etc.
